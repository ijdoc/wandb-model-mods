# W&B Components - log a custom app to any W&B Workspace

Weights & Biases (W&B) Components is a library of sample extensions you can log to any W&B workspace to customize and improve your ML workflows. The W&B Components library showcases two complementary uses:
1. **Log a component as an HTML media object** to extend the functionality of your W&B workspace with a fully customizable panel.
2. **Deploy a backend** to:
   - implement a custom endpoint to handle requests from your logged component, or
   - setup a serverless handler for your W&B automations (a.k.a. webhooks)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

#### Components
- Components are typically built with [react](https://react.dev/)-[vite](https://vitejs.dev/) into single HTML files so they can be logged to W&B as HTML media objects.

#### Backends
- We typically use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to manage python environments and dependencies

## Running Locally

### Components

```sh
cd <the-component>
npm run dev
```

### Demo Backend

```sh
cd backends/flask-demo-full
UV_ENV_FILE=".env.local" uv run python main.py
```

## Demo

Demo components are automatically deployed to W&B using Github Actions.

The backend at [backends/flask-demo-full/](backends/flask-demo-full/) provides endpoints for all sample components in this repo and it is deployed to a free[render](https://render.com/) instance.
